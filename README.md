# slot-project
This mini-project in Python represents a primitive slot machine with three rows and three columns (the number can be changed using global constants).
I call this slot "primitive" because it works in a following way:

      1. You can't choose on which lines you want to bet, just the amount of lines you want to bet on.
      2. Lines are counted from top to bottom (e.g. if you want to bet on two lines you would bet on the top one and the middle one)
      3. "Lines" are only horizontal, diagonal lines haven't been taken into account.
